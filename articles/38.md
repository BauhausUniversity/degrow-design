And, some day, words will also die.  
And we’ll just use beeps,  
0s and 1s,  
and without even noticing  
we’ll be back to the simplicity of Morse  
upgraded to a fake complexity  
flashing lights and sounds.  
They’ll sell us change as progress,  
we’ll become simpler,  
like an ancient word that once encompassed the  intangible,  
becoming trivial, insufficient.  
An “I love you” on autopilot.

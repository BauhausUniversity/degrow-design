Insane discussions between families and friends.  
Soon these relations will come to an end.  
Crazy opinions gonna tear them apart,  
but who cares?  

First comes the fire, then comes the ice.  
No one will be there to remember the fights.  
The fallout, you know, was our fault from the start,  
but who cares?

Remember your childhood, then unreached dreams blur.  
Can you already see the point of no return?  
The future could have had a dream on their own,  
but who cares?
